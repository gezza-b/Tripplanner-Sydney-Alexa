This initial release has the following limitations:

1. Trains for Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink only (this includes Brisbane/Melbourne to Sydney)
2. Other modes are not supported yet - feel free contribute to this project
3. A feature that I would love but have not included yet is: telling me where the quiet carriages are
